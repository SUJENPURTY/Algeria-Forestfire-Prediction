# Algeria-Forestfire-Prediction
 Algeria-Forestfire-Prediction ‚Äì Smart Fire Forecasting : 
A smart and simple machine learning project to predict forest fires in Algeria using weather and environmental data. From data cleaning to model building, this project helps in creating early warning systems that can reduce wildfire risks and protect nature.

# Project Workflow
1.Problem Understanding
- Understand the goal: Predict whether a forest fire will happen based on environmental data.

2. Data Collection
- Use the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset, which includes features like temperature, humidity, wind, and more.

3. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values
- Fix incorrect data
- Convert types and formats

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key variables (temperature, wind, rain, etc.)
- Check relationships and patterns
- Identify fire-prone conditions

5. Feature Engineering
-  Encode categorical variables (e.g., day, month)
-  Create new meaningful features if needed
-  Normalize or scale data for model input

6. Model Building
- Train ML models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Choose classification approach (fire/no fire)

7. Model Evaluation
- Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix and ROC curve to evaluate performance

8. Prediction & Testing
- Test the model with new/unseen data
- Predict chances of fire occurrence

9. Visualization & Insights
- Show important features using plots
- Display model outputs and comparisons

10 üìÅ Deployment (Optional)
- Host as a simple web app using Flask
- Make it interactive for users


 Optional Extras:
 Hyperparameter tuning
 Cross-validation
 Integration with weather APIs for real-time prediction
